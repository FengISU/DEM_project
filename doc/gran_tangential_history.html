<H3>gran tangential history 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>tangential history 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This granular model is based on the general description of granular
force interaction as described in <A HREF = "pair_gran.html">pair gran</A>.
</P>
<P>The spring part of the tangential force (k_t) is a "history" effect
that accounts for the tangential displacement ("tangential overlap")
between the particles for the duration of the time they are in contact.
</P>
<P>If this model is chosen, then this "tangential overlap" spring force is
actually calculated / taken into account.
The coefficient of friction cof is the upper limit of the tangential force through
the Coulomb criterion Ft = cof*Fn, where Ft and Fn are the tangential spring and normal
force components in the formulas above.
